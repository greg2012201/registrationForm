# registrationForm
Simple polish registration form writen in HTML, CSS, jQuery. 

## how to run

Clone or download repository then run index.html file. 
I used VScode and the LiveServer extension for development.


All js and css files are imported via script tag to the index.html.
JQuery is imported via script tag from CDN.
